Hi all! I'm Marcus, a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Georgia. My research interests lie at the intersection of data science and networking security. I enjoy learning new ways to represent data and developing machine learning models to address problems in various domains. I have had the pleasure to work on many interdisciplinary projects, where I have gained valuable experience in the domains of graph representation learning, computer vision, time-series analysis, and much more. Take a look around the site to learn more, and feel free to contact me via email.
